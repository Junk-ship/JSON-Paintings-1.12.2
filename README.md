## Misc info:

    Doesn't add any new painting entities or painting type handlers, but rather expands on vanilla's system, which means that this mod will work nicely with all other mods that don't override how paintings work!

    Paintings added through this mod use their own textures instead of being stuck to using vanilla's painting atlas texture!

    Allows paintings added through this mod to have custom back and side textures!

    Can override paintings! This could be used for example to give certain vanilla paintings custom back or side textures that match the front.

    Allows paintings added through this mod to be exclusive (if desired), and not be obtainable through painting cycling! This can be used for example to make certain paintings only obtainable through structures or quest rewards.
